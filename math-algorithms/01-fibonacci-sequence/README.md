# Fibonacci Sequence

## Problem

Give a number 'n', find the first 'n' elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.

## Example

- fibonacci(2) = [0, 1]
- fibonacci(3) = [0, 1, 1]
- fibonacci(4) = [0, 1, 1, 2]
- fibonacci(7) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

## Big O

- Time Complexity: O(n)
