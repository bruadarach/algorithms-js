# Recursive Fibonnaci Sequence

## Problem

Give a number 'n', find the n^th element of the Fibonacci sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...)

If F represents a function to calculate the Fibonacci number, then

```
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
```

```
F0 = 0 and F1 = 1
```

```
F2 = F1 + F0
F2 = 1 + 0
F2 = 1
```

## Example

- recursiveFibonacci(0) = 0
- recursiveFibonacci(1) = 1
- recursiveFibonacci(2) = 1
- recursiveFibonacci(6) = 8

## Tips for recursive solutions

- Figure out how to break down the problem into smaller versions of the same problem.
- Identify the base case for recursion.
