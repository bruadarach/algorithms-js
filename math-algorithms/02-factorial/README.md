# Factorial of a number

## Problem

Given a number, find the factorial of that number.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## Example

- Factorial of 0 is 1.
- factorial(4) = `4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`
- factorial(5) = `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

## Big O

- Time Complexity: O(n)
