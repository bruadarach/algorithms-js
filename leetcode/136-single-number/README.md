# 136. Single Number [(link)](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

<br>

## Example 1:

```js
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1];
Output: 1;
```

<br>

## Example 2:

```js
Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2];
Output: 4;
```

<br>

## Example 3:

```js
Input: nums = [1];
Output: 1;
```

<br>

## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 \* 104
- -3 \* 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 \* 104
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
